# Preface 

The importance of formal education is diversified. The prime goal of modern education is not to impart knowledge only but to build a prosperous nation by developing skilled human resources. At the same time, education is the best means of developing a society free from superstitions and adheres to science and facts. To stand as a developed nation in the science and technology-driven world of the 21 st century, we need to ensure quality education. A well-planned education is essential for enabling our new generation to face the challenges of the age and to motivate them with the strength of patriotism, values, and ethics. In this context, the government is determined to ensure education as per the demand of the age.
Education is the backbone of a nation and a curriculum provides the essence of formal education. Again, the most important tool for implementing a curriculum is the textbook. The National Curriculum 2012 has been adopted to achieve the goals of the National Education Policy 2010. In light of this, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has been persistently working on developing, printing, and distributing quality textbooks. This organization also reviews and revises the curriculum, textbook, and assessment methods according to needs and realities.
Secondary education is a vital stage in our education system. This textbook is catered to the age, aptitude, and endless inquisitiveness of the students at this level, as well as to achieve the aims and objectives of the curriculum. It is believed that the book written and meticulously edited by experienced and skilled teachers and experts will be conducive to a joyful experience for the students. It is hoped that the book will play a significant role in promoting creative and aesthetic spirits among students along with subject knowledge and skills.
In the Bangladesh and Global Studies for Class VI, sociology, history, civics, economics, and population related issues have been presented in an integrated way. With this, students will get a clear picture of the society, environment, history, tradition, culture, and socio-economic and political conditions of Bangladesh. Along with these, it will be them build their status and identity on a large scale. It is hoped that by practicing the contents, they will make themselves as responsible global citizen. By using the acquired knowledge, they can play an important role in the development of the society and provide solutions to the global problems.
It may be mentioned here that due to the changing situation in 2024 and as per the needs the textbook has been reviewed and revised for the academic year 2025. It is mentionable here that the last version of the textbook developed according to the curriculum 2012 has been taken as the basis. Meticulous attention has been paid to the textbook to make it more learner-friendly and error-free. However, any suggestions for further improvement of this book will be appreciated.

# Chapter One 

## History of Social Evolution

The world we live in is made up of people, as well as many species of plants, animals and sea creatures. In the primitive period, man was helpless in the face of animals' attack, natural disasters and other perils. To survive and to fulfill the demand of life, they felt the necessity of mutual cooperation. Thus, in the process of developing mutual cooperation, man built up society. Not only humans, but also among animals and insects we observe gregarious lifestyle. For example, elephants like to live and move in groups. If a crow falls in danger, all the crows come to his rescue. Bees make be-hives and white ants make ant-hills to live together in harmony. By reading the lessons of this chapter, we shall learn about the society and civilization process of Bangladesh, what society is and how it developed.

## At the end of this chapter, we will be able to-

- explain the idea of human society;
- describe the influence of natural and geographical environment on social life;
- narrate different phases of social development, such as Socio-economic and cultural situation of hunting and food gathering, horticulture, pastoral, agrarian, Industrial and post-industrial society;
- analyze the nature of Bangladeshi society according to the features of evolution;
- make a comparison between agrarian society and the process of production in the modern age;
- realize the importance of evolution in social development.


## Lesson-1 : Concept of Society

Man cannot live alone. They live in groups to lead a safe- and sound life. As a result, friendship and kin relationships are formed among them. Different social relationships like help and cooperation, sympathy, conflict and mutual reliance develop among them. All these are social relationships. Human race living together in harmony is called society.

Small institutions and organizations, such as- family, clan, club, co-operative are parts of a society. We live in a certain family. Parents living together with one or more of their children form a family. In some families, apart from parents and their children, the family consists of the bonds and activities of other individuals including their siblings or uncles, aunts, grandparents, etc. Family is the first phase of forming a society. In ancient time, there was nothing like family before the society was formed. Man had to live fighting with


## Page 7

hostile environment. So, people felt the necessity of living together to collect food and to save themselves from the attack of ferocious animals. Thus, man formed society. From family, man formed clan, community and nation. Thus, large society emerged from small units.
Normally, there are two characteristics of a society. Firstly, man lives together and secondly, there are purposes behind living together. Therefore, by society, we mean man's mutual relationship on the ground of which he lives for special purposes and needs for living together.

Task-1: Be divided in groups and act out the group works of the primitive society.

# Lesson-2: Impact of Natural and Geographical Environment on Social Life 

Human life is influenced by natural and geographical environment. Man sometimes influences the environment, but he is controlled by the environment most of the time. That is why the impact of environment is distinct on the ways of life, manners and culture of a society.
Rivers simplify human lifestyle. Major civilizations of the world developed on the bank of rivers. For example, Indus civilization developed on the bank of the river Sind, Egyptian civilization on the bank of the river Nile, and Mesopotamian civilization developed on the bank of Tigris River and Euphrates River. The ancient civilization of Bangladesh developed on the basin of the river Ganges.
Again, the occupation of the people depends on the natural resources of that region. For instance, the miners live in mine regions, and industrial workers live in industrial areas. Because of being a riverine country, the transports of most of the regions of Bangladesh are boat, launch and steamer. Again, the transports of some regions are train, bus, rickshaw and bullock cart.
Geographical environment has its impact on the development of cottage industries. Because of riverine area and favourable climate, the weavers live at Demra in Dhaka. The famous Dhakai Saree is woven here. Silk Saree and cloth industries have been established in Rajshahi because mulberry trees grow in this region and silk-worms make their nests in mulberry trees.
The Molasses of Faridpur, Manda (sweetmeat) of Muktagasa, Saree of Tangail, Honey of the Sunderbans, Sitol Pati of Sylhet are related to the geographical environment of those regions. The famous Muslin industry of Sonargaon also developed due to geographical environment and availability of raw materials.
Geographical environment also influences dress and dwelling. People of cold regions wear warm silk cloth, while people of tropical regions put on light cotton cloth. The people of the places where earthquakes take place frequently make their houses with


## Page 8

woods. Industrialization and urbanization develop easily where there is advanced transportation. Because of good waterways, industries were set up at Narayanganj and Chattogram from long ago.

Task: Mark in the map of Bangladesh the places famous for Saree, Shitol Pati and Sericulture

# Lesson-3 and 4: Different Stages in the Evolution of Society: Hunting and Food Gathering, Horticulture and Pastoral Society 

Society is changeable. The old society was not like our present day society. The society of today's Bangladesh is the result of long gradual evolution. In course of time, with the development of knowledge and science, the old society quickly changed and modern society of today was formed. Society will change more in future. With the passage of time, these changes of society can be divided into six types. These are: (1) hunting and food gathering society, (2) horticultural society, (3) pastoral society, (4) agrarian society, (5) industrial society and (6) post industrial society.

## Hunting and Food Gathering Society

Hunting and food gathering society is the oldest organized society. At that time, there were no permanent houses. Men used to live in caves and woods. Then natural resources were in plenty. But man still did not know how to produce food using these resources. They used to procure food and go out for hunting in the forest. They moved from one place to another in search of food. The main work of the primitive people was to collect fruits, fishing and hunting birds and animals. When they could hunt, they could eat, otherwise they had to starve. The women folk used to gather fruits and men went for hunting. At that time, stone was the only tool for hunting. For this reason, this society is calledprehistoric or stone age society.
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

The tools used to collect food in the primitive society
The remarkable tools of this society were notched spear, harpoon for fishing and needles made of bones. People used bark of trees, creepers, herbs and hide to protect themselves from the cold, sun and rain. The people of this society could not form strong organization or institution. Then, man had to move from one place to another place in search of food.

## Page 9

# Horticultural Society 

In this society, men became food producers from food collectors. Sociologists say that women had started cultivation. In the primitive society, women had the responsibility for gathering fruits. Men went for hunting. In the process of gathering fruits, women collected wild wheat and barley, potato, esculent root and tubers. Saplings grew from seeds of wheat and barley that fell around their dwelling places. Then the saplings would bear ear of corn and crops. They saw this incident and thought of growing crops scattering seeds. This stage of agriculture is called horticulture. Women made holes with a long stick or animal horn on the waste land around their dwelling places. Putting seeds in the holes, they produced crops and fruits. They reaped mature crops with the jaw-bones of animals. But they did not grow more crops than they needed. As such crops could not be grown in one place repeatedly, Their life was nomadic.

## Pastoral Society

In the course of social development, start of cattle rearing led the society further ahead. Besides food gathering, people of this society started taming and rearing cattle. The hunters initially tamed the dog and made it a domestic animal. The dog was a faithful protector and a hunting companion. Sometimes, wild oxen, sheep, goats, donkeys and other animals were caught alive. Man kept these animals tied with rope. These animals were living food store for them. If there were no animals available to hunt, they slaughtered these animals for food. Gradually people began to realize that keeping cows and goats alive can be more profitable than killing them. For example, they would get milk daily and calf annually, and fur and hide would be used for various purposes. Thus, the increase of domestic animals in the society became an asset to people.
There was no use of currency in the pastoral society. But people invented barter system. Animals of one man would be exchanged with the animals or anything else of another man. However, like the primitive people, the people of pastoral society were wanderers as well.

## Page 10

Task : Being divided into groups, identify the characteristics of three societies mentioned above and present them.

# Lesson-5 and 6 : Stages of Social Development: Agrarian, Industrial and Post- Industrial Revolution Society 

## Agrarian Society

Though women started cultivation, men took the responsibility of farming after the invention of plough. Initially they started tilling taking yoke on their shoulder. In course of time, they started using bullocks. The use of plough and bullocks increased food production. In the areas of flood and siltation, they scattered the seeds of wheat and barley on land. These regions were the Tigris-Euphrates basin, the banks of the Nile and the Indus Valley. In that period, it rained heavily in West Asia and Africa. So, agriculture gradually developed in these regions. Subsequently, agriculture flourished in Africa, Europe and other places of Asia. With the spread of agriculture, the necessity of cattle rearing increased further.

Agriculture has advanced the development of society and civilization. Population increased in the regions which were suitable for agriculture. People of this society started living permanently. Agriculture ensured man's supply of food and surplus food was produced. Surplus food created a class of people who did not work. Some of them took part in business and commerce, and contributed to the development of urban life. Surplus agricultural production initiated civilization. For this reason, it is said that civilization is the contribution of agriculture.

## Industrial Society

Significant development in agriculture was made in Europe in the later period of the middle age. Man's attraction for knowledge and science increased. The Europeans discovered the knowledge and science of ancient Greek and Roman tradition. This is known in Europe as regeneration or renaissance. The men of Europe during this time came out to know the unknown, to discover the world. In the 1492 A.D. Columbus reached America. Newton presented his epoch-making discovery of gravitation in the 1685 A.D. In this way discoveries brought out one after another.

**Mechanized Production in Industrial Society**

In the eighteen century, steam engine was invented in England. It brought a revolution in the system of production. Using the concept of steam engine, the scientists invented shuttle or spinning machine, mechanical loom, steamship and rail engine. At this time, electricity was invented. Electricity began to be produced with a special kind of steam engine named steam turbine. Thus, on one hand, production started in large factories, on the other hand, trade, commerce and communication expanded by speedy ships and railways. In this way, industrial revolution started in Europe and the pioneer was England.

The use of coal, gas, petrol and electricity began in the 18th-19th century. Railway communication started in the 19th century. To satisfy the increasing demand of labour and raw materials in industries, the men of Europe established colony in Asia and Africa. Since then, there was worldwide impact of industrial revolution. The use of aeroplane, radio, cinema and television began in the 20th century.

**Post Industrial Revolution Society**

In the industrial society, machine takes the place of man and animals as the source of energy. After the industrial revolution, the base of society is knowledge and information. The main feature of the society is information processing rather than industry. Instead of property~owners, professionals, service~holders, scientists, information engineers, and people involved in service and recreation become important. Automatic machine, computer, mobile phone and various media of communication, for example-facebook, has made the world a global village. This process is called globalization.

Task: Get into groups and identify the features of agricultural society and industrial society.

# Lesson-7: Nature of Society in Bangladesh 

With the advancement of time, today the society of Bangladesh has changed into a modern society. Signs of primitive human settlement have been found in Lalmai of Cumilla, Uari-Bateshwar of Narsingdi and in some regions of Chattogram and Sylhet. These ancestors of the Bangalees introduced agriculture in this region. At that time surplus crops were produced in agriculture. Depending on these surplus crops, some other occupations, such as, artisans, businessmen and workers developed. In the agricultural society, various customs, beliefs, values and festivals emerged keeping agriculture at the centre. Along with agricultural work, there were hunting and cattle rearing.

However, in the 18th century, Bangladesh entered the colonial era after losing the battle of Palashi. In that era any attempt to create industry in the region had to be guided by the management of the British Empire. Because of this, during the British period, the possibility of local industrialization of this country was destroyed, and the idea of dependent development grew, which continued until the Pakistan period. entering into a developed stage of the society does not mean the abolition of the previous stages. That is why, though the city-based population of Bangladesh has entered into post-industrial revolution era, they still maintain traditions of the previous social stages to some extent. Therefore, horticulture, cattle rearing, agriculture is contributing much to our economy. Still in this country there are Garo, Tripura, Chakma ethnic groups dependent on horticulture, as well as animal husbandry groups. Again, small farmers are sustaining agriculture according to the ancient tradition, but at the same time, there are enough market-oriented farmers and agro-based industries. And heavy industry has also developed lately. Although industry did not develop during the Pakistani period due to the neglect of the rulers, but after independence, the agricultural production in Bangladesh increased manifold as well as the industry expanded widely. In cities like Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna and on their outskirts, large-scale industries and business establishments have also developed.

At present, in the post- industrial-revolution era, with the extreme development of information technology, Bangladesh has joined in the information technology revolution. Now, in Bangladesh, multi-dimensional technology including Internet, software and networking are being used in every quarter of day-to-day life including administrative, educational, social and cultural sectors.

Task : "Society of Bangladesh is the result of gradual development of human society." Analyze.

# Chapter Two 

## History of Bangladesh

Although Bangladesh was born as an independent state in 1971, the history of Bengal is very old. Counting from the ancient era, the middle age came in succession of Maurya, Sunga, Kushan, Gupta, Pala and Sena regimes. Muslim rule was established in Bengal after the conquest of Nadia by Bakhtiyar Khalji. The Ilyas Shahi and Hussain Shahi dynasties established a strong governance structure in Bengal. After the defeat of Nawab Sirajuddaula in the Battle of Palashi, Bengal and India came under the British rule. After liberation from them, present day Bangladesh was named East Pakistan. After a long movement and struggle, we got our Bangladesh in 1971 through victory in the Great War of Liberation.

At the end of this chapter, we will be able to-

- narrate the sequence of human settlement in Bengal;
- make an age-wise division of the political history;
- describe the socio-economic, cultural and religious life of ancient Bengal;
- describe the political situation of Bengal in the Middle Ages;
- describe the political life of Bengal in the modern age;
- narrate in the country's origin, culture, civilization, tradition and liberation war.


## Lesson- 1, 2 and 3 : Human Settlement and Political History of Bangladesh

Human settlement existed in this territory of Bangladesh since ancient times. The antiquity of this land has been proved by recently discovered archeology. Pre-historic weapons, such as- axe made of stone and burnt wood, chisel, point of an arrow have been discovered at Rangamati and Sitakunda in Chattogram, Lalmai of Cumilla, Chunarughat of Hobigonj, Uari- Bateshwar of Narsingdi. People in the stone age used to live in the forests as nomads. After that, prosperous human settlements developed at Mahasthangarh in Bogura and Uari-Bateshwar in Narsingdi. The ancient city of Mahasthangarh is called Pundranagar which was built in the 4th century BC. On the other hand, traces of important human


## Page 16

settlements have also been found from Uari-Bateshwar. In modern times, the names of 16 Mahajanapadas (vast settlements) of the Indian subcontinent are known.

The pre-Maurya political history of various settlements in the subcontinent is known. However, the inscription found as the primary evidence of the history of the present part of Bangladesh is considered to be of the Maurya era. According to many, the inscription was issued by Emperor Ashoka. From the details of this inscription, it is assumed that the Maurya emperor Ashoka ruled Pundranagar. Then successive dynasties ruled the present territory of Bangladesh.

# Gupta Age 

The detailed history of our country is known from the Gupta period. They were the rulers of the north region of the Indian subcontinent. A province called Pundravardhan Bhukti in the northern part of Bangladesh was under the rule of the Guptas. We have to remember that today's Bangladesh was not a single country in ancient times. Different regions of Bangladesh were known as Pundravardhan, Banga, Samatata, Gaur, Barendra, Harikel etc.

## Shashanka

After the fall of the Gupta rule, the names of a few kings are found. This period is known as 'Later Gupta' period when there were three famous kings: Gopacandra, Dharmaditya and Samacharadeva. Then in the seventh century a powerful ruler named Shashanka can be identified. He was the ruler of Gaur. His surname was Gaudeshwar. After his death, there was no permanent ruler in ancient Bengal for about a hundred years. In chaos, the small states of Bengal were involved in quarrels and wars among themselves.

## Pala Dynasty

The Pala dynasty ruled Bengal for a long time. Gopala was the founder of this dynasty. He removed the tyranny of 'Matsyanyaya' i.e. chaos like a fish kingdom and sat on the throne of Gaur. After Gopala, Dharmapala, Devapala, Rampala and Mahipala were the famous rulers of this dynasty. The Pala dynasty ruled Bengal for about 400 years. During their period, Bengal flourished in politics, economy, architecture, painting and art. The famous Paharpur Mahavihara of Naogaon district is a monument of Pala Dynasty.


## Page 17

During the period of the Pala rulers, outside their dominions, the Kharag, Deva, Chandra and Varma dynasties ruled independently in the Cumilla and Vikrampur regions. Hiuen Tsang, the famous Chinese traveler, traveled to this region known as Samatata. He found as many as 30 Buddhist monasteries here. Atish Dipankar was a famous scholar of Bikrampur region at that time. He went to Tibet to preach Buddhism in the 11th century.

# Sena dynasty 

The Senas came to Bengal from Karnataka in the Deccan of India to serve in the Pala army. Vijaya Sen seized power defeating the weak Pala king Madanapala. Then the kings were Ballal Sen and Laxman Sen. Vijay Sen and Ballal Sen belonged to the Shaivite community. Laxman Sen later became a devotee of the Vaishnava community. Defeating Laxman Sen, the Turkish general Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji conquered Nadia. However, after Laxman Sen, his two sons Biswaroop Sen and Keshav Sen ruled the region from Bikrampur for some time.

Task 1 : Make a list of the pre-historic archaeological sites and weapons along with their finding places.
Task 2 : Make a list of the townships in Bengal.
Task 3 : Make a list of dynasties of Ancient Bengal
We do not know much about the socio-economic, cultural and religious life of ancient Bangladesh. Limited literary and archaeological sources provide inadequate information. In the following Lessons, we shall know about the socio-economic, cultural and religious life of Bangladesh in the ancient times.

## Lesson-4 : Glories of Ancient Bangladesh: Society, Economics, Religion

Agriculture: In the Primitive Age, agriculture was the main economic power of Bangladesh. In that period, paddy was the main crop. Besides, sugarcane was also produced in plenty. Molasses and sugar, made of sugarcane had reputation. Molasses and sugar were exported to other countries. bengal had fame for the cultivation of cotton, mustard seed and betel-leaf. Several types of fruits like coconut, betel-nut, mango, jackfruit, banana, fig etc. were also remarkable.


## Page 18

Cottage Industry: Since the ancient age, the weavers of Bengal could weave fine cotton and silk cloth. Our muslin was world famous which was exported to other countries even then. Besides this, earthen pots, metallic pots and ornaments were made. Sculpture and statue made from burnt clay were praise-worthy arts of the Ancient bengal. Stamped silver coins, low precious stones and glass beads were also produced.

Trade and Commerce: Trade and commerce flourished as there was surplus in agricultural crops and increase in industrial production. Small markets and shops were established near the banks of the river. Most of the trade and commerce were done by river. Uari-Bateshwar and Pundranagor (Mahasthangar) were prosperous river ports. Besides various ports of India, goods of the then Bengal had been sent to SouthEast Asia and Mediterranean region.

Religion and Community: It is anticipated that in the Stone Age, the people of this area, like the people of other regions, worshipped high mountains, rivers, the moon, the sun and so on. Under the patronization of the Buddhist rulers for a long time, Buddhism became the dominating religion. Pala emperors patronized Buddhism. Religious harmony is identified as a characteristic of the Pala period.

Task-1 : Make a list of the cottage industries of Bangladesh.

# Lesson-5: Entertainment, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting of Ancient Bengal 

Entertainment: Dancing, singing, drama, dueling and wrestling were prevalent as the part of entertainment in Bangladesh in ancient times. Evidence of staging drama has been found at Paharpur Buddhist Vihara. All the 'Sebadasi' in the temple had to be good at dancing, singing and playing musical instruments. The pictures of Kanshor, kartal, trumpet, lyre, flute, tabor, mritbhando are found inscribed on the burnt clay slab.

Architecture: Brick-built architecture has been discovered from Mahasthangarh and Wari-Bateshwar as the most ancient symbol. The people of Bengal excelled in architecture during the rule Pala Dynasty. Emperor Dharmapala alone is said to have built 50 Buddhist monasteries.

Shalban Vihara, Maynamati, Cumilla

Sculpture and painting: Terracotta, stone and metal sculptures and statues discovered from areas like Wari-Bateshwar, Mahasthangarh, Paharpur and Mainamati give an insight into the art of ancient Bengal. The art style of Gupta and Pala period sculptures was unique. Two renowned sculptors of the Pala Era, Dheeman and Beetpal achieved much fame. The greatest artist of the Sena Era was Shulpani. In various manuscripts of the time, Buddhist gods and goddesses were depicted through images.

Task-1 : Getting divided in groups, make a list of ancient monuments and sculpture.

# Lesson-6: Language, literature and education of the ancient Bengal 

## Language and Literature:

Written inscriptions engraved on stone and copper sheet have been found from various places in Bengal. The black stone inscription from Mahasthangarh in Bogura is the oldest among them. Many inscriptions of the Gupta, Pala and Sena eras have also been found. The number of scripts issued by the rulers of Southeast Bengal is also large. From these scripts we get an idea about the language and alphabet of ancient Bengal. Poet Sandhyakar Nandi wrote the famous book Ramcharit about the events of Pala era.

Besides this, Charyapada was also composed during the Pala period. Charyapada is recognized as an ancient testament of Bengali language. Among the Sena kings, Raja Ballal Sen composed Danasagar and Advutasagar.

## Page 20

# Education: 

The education of Bengal, before the Pala Era, cannot be known much about. Seeing the spread of education in this time, it can be anticipated that education spread in the Maurya and Gupta Era as well. Each vihara was an educational institution, especially the Buddhist students studied there. Here, the teachers were called Acharya or Vikshu, while the students were called Shromon. In the vihara, there was arrangement for accomodation of the students like today's residential universities. In viharas, not only religious books but also medicine, grammar, astrology and various other subjects were taught. From this discussion, it is clear that the people of ancient Bengal was more advanced in the field of education than many other countries of the world.

Task-1 : Make a list of the literary works of pala and sena Era.

## Lesson-7 : Bengal during the muslim rule

The medieval period in Bengal began in 1204 AD. The Turkish Muslim general Ikhtiar Uddin Mohammad Bakhtiar Khalzi defeated king Laxman Sena. Subsequently, the Turkish Muslim general spread Muslim rule all over Bangladesh. Even before this, Muslim rule started in India. Delhi was their capital. The generals sent by the emperors of Delhi started to rule Bengal as administrators. Bengal was far away from Delhi. Communication was not good at all. Being full of resources, the responsible rulers in Bengal wanted to run the country independently. Many of them declared independence against the sultan of Delhi. the whole of bengal became independet during the reign of sultan Shamsuddin llyas Shah.

The independence of Bengal lasted for two hundred years from 1338 AD to 1538 AD. Two important sultanic dynasties ruled the two hundred years of Bengal's independent history. One of which is well known as the Ilyas Shahi and the other Husain Shahi dynasty. Alauddin Hossain Shah was the best ruler of Hossain Shahi dynasty. In 1526, the Delhi Sultanate came to an end. Then Mughal rule began in India centered on Delhi. They also tried to take over Bengal. They did not succeed at first. Afghans had zamindari in Bihar region then. Their famous leader was Sher Khan Shur. He also sat on the throne of Delhi assuming the title Sher Shah. It was through him that Afghan rule began in Bengal. Even Mughal Emperor Akbar could not occupy this country of ours. The big landlords of Bengal were called Twelve Bhuiyan at that time. Together they saved Bengal from the Mughals. In 1610 AD during the reign of Emperor

Jahangir, general Islam Khan Chishti occupied Bengal. Bengal became a suba or province under the Mughals after losing its freedom. This rule lasted till 1757 AD.

Task: Prepare a list of rulers of Bengal during the Muslim rule.

# Lesson-8: Bengal during the colonial period 

The post-medieval period in Bengal is known as the colonial period. This period is called colonial rule as the colonial British dominated Bengal during this period. Initially, from 1757, the English East India Company exploited Bengal in various ways. Then in 1857 the Sepoy Revolution took place. After that, Bengal came directly under the rule of the queen. The long period from the defeat of Nawab Sirajuddaula in the Battle of Palashi to India's independence (1757-1947 AD) can be characterized as colonial rule.

When Nawab Siraj was defeated in the battle of Palashi, the traitor Mir Zafar Ali Khan became the nominal Nawab of Bengal. Then they put Mir Jafar's son-in-law Mir Qasim in power. In the beginning, Mir Qasim was obedient but later rebelled against the British. After he was defeated in the Battle of Boxer, Bengal came under British control completely.

Not only Bengal, the entire Indian subcontinent was ruled by the British for almost two hundred years until 1947 AD. India was initially ruled by the East India Company and later by Queen Victoria of England. British rulers ruled the Indian subcontinent as the representative of the Queen. The people of Bengal could not accept their misrule. They protested against the British rule at various stages. Many movements and struggles were formed against them, including Fakir Sannyasi Rebellion, Sepoy Revolution, Titumir's Rebellion, Faraiji Movement, and Indigo Rebellion. Finally, the famous 'Quit India' movement started. The British were forced to leave the Indian subcontinent in 1947. This resulted in the birth of two independent states, India and Pakistan.

Pakistan was made up of two distinct regions. The western part of the two geographically distant territories was called West Pakistan and the eastern part was called East Pakistan. The ruling power of Pakistan divided into two territories at that time was in the hands of West Pakistanis. They also exploited the people of East


## Page 22

Pakistan in many ways. At one point, the people of East Pakistan united in the struggle for rights. The West Pakistani rulers realized that their hegemony over East Pakistan could no longer be maintained. On March 25, 1971, the Pakistani army attacked and started massacre. The people of East Pakistan resisted them. On March 26, Major Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh from the Kalurghat radio station in Chattogram. Then he declared independence again on March 27 on behalf of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. On December 16, 1971, a new country, Bangladesh, was born after nine months of bloody war.

# Chapter Three 

## Culture and Society of Bangladesh

Since the dawn of civilization, man has satisfied his demand using nature and environment. A piece of stone or a branch of a tree became the tool to save him from the attack of ferocious animals. Hence, the ability to utilize nature has endowed man with culture which is still continuous. Man realized that the struggle for survival would be stronger if he lived in society. So, various rules were created in order to organize the society. Gradually it turned into economics, politics, religion, education etc. For the amusement, recreation and welfare of the people of the society, man created dance, song, literature and many other things. As a result, concrete and abstract shapes of culture were composed.
![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)

At the end of this chapter, we will be able to-

- explain the concept of culture;
- explain the elements of Bangladeshi culture;
- explain the characteristics of Bangladeshi culture;
- explain the type of Bangladeshi culture;
- hold and nurture Bngladesh's own culture in individual and group life.


## Lesson- 1: Concept of Culture

Culture is actually the lifestyle of people. Picture of human life is revealed through culture. All a man does and thinks to preserve his existence and to serve some purposes are his culture. For example, man eats food to live. When this food is cooked following various recipe and served with nice decoration, it becomes man's culture. When man learnt to write, first he wrote curving on stone or on bark or leaves of trees. Then, when paper was invented, man began writing with feather sinking in ink. Gradually man invented paper and started writing on paper. After that man invented typewriter and started writing with it. Finally man invented computer. Now, many people of the world write with computer. The total of all these forms of writing invented by man is a part of culture.

Task : "The way of our life is our culture." Explain.

# Lesson-2 : Elements of Bangladeshi Culture 

We can see some elements of Bangladeshi culture with our eyes, hold them with hand. Again, we can neither see nor touch many elements of culture of this country. For example, we can see the houses built by the people of Bangladesh, but we do not see the knowledge and skill of building them. From this consideration, the elements of Bangladeshi culture can also be divided into two kinds, such as- (1) concrete or visible elements, (2) abstract or invisible elements.

Concrete elements of the culture of this country are various kinds of houses, furniture, dress, transport, food, farming tools and books. Abstract elements of our culture are collective knowledge, outlook and attitude, religious belief and sense of morality, language, alphabet, arts, literature, music, ideals and values, various branches of knowledge and science etc.

The people of our country created the concrete elements of culture for their own necessity. These elements can last for hundreds of years. For example, when we visit the museum, we see many things which are hundred years old. Seeing those, we can form a concept about man and culture of Bangladesh at that time.

The concrete and abstract elements of our culture are, in no way, isolated from each other. It is because we get the identity of abstract elements through the concrete elements. For instance, Nakshi Kantha is a concrete element of Bangladeshi culture. When flower-leaf, elephant-horse or any scenery is embroidered in it, then it becomes the manifestation of thoughts of women folk of this country.

Change in one element of Bangladeshi culture brings about changes in other elements. For example, Saree is an element of culture in Bangladesh. Due to technological changes, there have been changes in colour and design of saree. Change is noticed in the fashion of wearing saree as well.

Task : Give examples of concrete and abstract elements of Bangladeshi culture.


## Page 26

# Lesson - 3 : Pattern of Bangladeshi Culture 

Geographical environment, weather, method of production etc. play special role to build up culture. As a result, culture differs from country to country. Again, many kinds of culture can develop in a single country. Hence, culture is not stagnant, rather it is changeable. It is not that the whole culture changes. Some major aspects of culture remain unchanged for a long time.

Many kinds of culture can be practised within a single country depending on the characteristics like occupation, gender, age, location, process of production, education, religion and so on. For instance, rural culture differs from urban culture. In the geographical environment of the village, there are ponds, rivers, canals, creaks, mountains, seas, fields spread up to the horizon etc. The occupations like farming, pisciculture, boatmanship etc. contribute to constructing rural culture. The main food of Bangladeshi culture, rice and fish, is still an inseparable part of rural food habit. Many regional songs like Bhaoaya, Bhatiali, Murshidi, Baromasya, Gambhira etc. reflect the happiness and sorrows of the rural people. At the outset of winter, arrangement of Jatrapala, after harvest season, still retains the uniqueness of village in the modern age. On the contrary, geographical environment of the town, occupation, mechanized life have built up the urban culture. Along with traditional culture of Bangladesh, here we find modern buildings, plenty of motor cars etc. The impact of globalization is seen more in the town.

In the same way, people of different occupations form different cultural trends. Dissimilarity is noticed in celebrating festivals and ceremonies among the lower class, the middle class and the higher class people. There are also differences between men and women regarding dress, lifestyle and thoughts.

Since the primitive period, our language culture has developed with the vocabulary consisting of words from various language groups. Our language style consists of various language families like Austro-Asian, Dravidian, Tibetan-Burmese, and Inda-European etc. Later on, our language has borrowed many words and styles from the colonial rulers like the Dutch, the Portuguese, the French, and the English.

In an overall evaluation, the culture of Bangladesh has been humanitarian from the very ancient period which we have learnt in the previous lessons. We get its evidence in many ways. The fair on the occasion of the Chaitra Sankrati bear testimony to our traditional farming culture. Similarly, various festivals of small ethnic groups, such as the Garoes' wangala, the Saontals' Sohrai are equal partners of our farming culture.


## Page 27

The Monipuri dance, the Jhumur dance of a small ethnic group of North Bengal, bottle dance of he Tripura etc. have enriched our culture. Our national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote many songs in Jhumur rhythm.

Therefore, we shall constantly practise our cultural variety through receiving, discarding, refining and developing other cultures, and through changes advance our culture forward.

Task: Be divided in groups and identify the patterns of Bangladeshi culture.

# Chapter Four 

## Economy of Bangladesh

The economy of Bangladesh is mainly agriculture based. Alongside agriculture, industry, trade and commerce have flourished. In the country, there are some state-owned industries, railway and road communication etc. At present, garments industry has developed in our country that is contributing much to our economy. Even though the inequality in the life of the working people is not eliminated, some positive changes are coming in their lives as well. No country or nation can survive without economic development. If unemployment and poverty can be removed from the country, the people of the country will also be able to lead a better life. We will learn about that in the lessons of this chapter.

## After studying this chapter, we will be able to -

- narrate the economic life of the people of Bangladesh;
- narrate the economic work of village and town;
- compare between rural and urban economy;
- describe the major economic sectors of Bangladesh;
- realize the importance of economic development of Bangladesh;
- explain the prospect of the economy of Bangladesh;
- explain how the population of Bangladesh can be an asset;
- be aware of economic activities and be encouraged to turn myself into a skilled manpower.


## Lesson- 1 and 2 : Economic Way of Life

The economic work, done by any society or a group of people as livelihood, is called the economic way of life of that society or population group. Most of the people of rural Bangladesh are farmers. They grow crops cultivating the land. They meet their demand of food with that. They sell a portion of their crops in the market and fulfill the other needs of the family with the money. Producing surplus crops, they provide food for the people of the country. In this way, they contribute to the economic development of the country. In the same way, the economic way of life of the urban workers, industrialists, officers and businessmen centers round either industry or commerce.


## Page 30

# Rural Economy of Bangladesh

Most of the people of Bangladesh live in villages. Most of the people in the village depend on agriculture. Agriculture is their main occupation. Even those who have no land of their own, work on the land of others and earn their livelihood. That means several crores of people of the country depend directly on agriculture. That is why Bangladesh is called an agro-based country. Other than agriculture, a section of the rural people earns their livelihood as fishermen, weavers, blacksmiths, potters, carpenters, and grocers. Some people run small trades in the village hats and bazaars, or in the nearby cities and towns. The rural economy of Bangladesh remains dynamic with all of them.

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)

At present, modern tools, fertilizers, insecticides, and hybrid seeds are being used in agriculture. As a result, not only the production of crops has increased, but also a new prospect for rural economy has been created. It has also created environmental hazards, affecting the overall lifestyle of the village people including education and health.

# Importance of Rural Economy 

The greater portion of our demand for food comes from agriculture and the village people are the main producers. The main source of industrial raw materials of the country is rural agricultural sector. That is, trade and commerce and employment depend mostly on the rural economy. In this way, rural economy is still acting as the main basis of our national economy.
![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)

## Urban Economy of Bangladesh

About 30\% people of the total population of Bangladesh live in cities. A large number of people live in capital Dhaka, port city Chattogram,Industrial city Narayanganj and in Khulna. Apart from these cities, people living in divisional, district and upazilla towns do jobs in offices, courts, mills and factories, run trade and commerce, drive vehicles, do domestic work in the houses and serve as day labourers and thus earn their livelihood. The rich among the city dwellers live in the aristocratic areas. The middle class and the lower class people live in their own houses or in the rented houses according to their ability. Besides, a vast number of people live in slums. The number of floating people is not small in big cities. They spend the night in the footpath, parks, railway station, launch terminal etc. To survive, they also have to earn some sort of livelihood. Industrialists, businessmen, service holders, professionals, workers, day labourers and slum dwellers, all getting together, keep the urban economic life active.

### Importance of Urban Economy

The difference between the rural and urban way of life is getting reduced to some extent due to industrialization and urbanization. Interdependence of village and city is increasing. Now, the village people are more dependent on cities than before for education, employment, healthcare etc. Everyday lots of people come to cities due to expansion of urban life, industrialization and in search of work. Moreover, all the rising rich people live in the city and so the role of urban economy is huge in the net production. As a result, the role of city people is getting more important in the national economy day by day.

**Task:** Mark the importance of economic activities of village and city of Bangladesh.

### Lesson-3: Economic Sectors of Bangladesh

Like other countries of the world, the economic sectors of our country are agriculture, industry, trade-commerce and service. In addition, the money sent by the immigrants plays big role in the economy of Bangladesh.

a. **Agriculture:** From the ancient time, agriculture has been playing a key role in the economy of Bangladesh. Even today, most of the people depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Paddy, jute, tea, pulse, robi crops, producing vegetables and fruits, forest resources, livestock rearing, pisciculture are considered as agricultural sectors. The contribution of agriculture in our national economy is more than 20%.

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-13.png)


## Page 33

b. Industry: This sector includes materials produced in factories, electricity, gas, mineral resources, construction of building and infrastructure etc. The remarkable industrial products of Bangladesh are jute and leather products, thread and cloth. Besides these, there are paper mill, garments industry, furniture workshop, sugar mill, food processing industry, petrol and chemical industry, medicine industry etc.
C. Trade and Commerce: Domestic and foreign trade is the main economic sector. The buying and selling of products within the country on personal and institutional initiative is called domestic trade. This domestic trade plays an important role in keeping the economy of the country vigorous. We import some of the goods to meet the local demand, just as we export some of the goods producing in plenty in our country. In this way, foreign currency earned by exporting goods strengthens our economy.
d. Service Sector: Service sector plays an important role in the economy of any country. Education, healthcare, housing, transport or communications, bank-insurance, public administration, law enforcing agencies are the examples of service sector. This sector is run by both public and private enterprise. The more a country is developed and more importance is given on public welfare, the more vigorous is the service sector there.
e. Remittances sent by the expatriates: Remittances from expatriate workers play a huge role in the economy of Bangladesh. They are the main pillar of the country's economy even though the government facilities are not that much for them. In a modern state, no sector is less important among Agriculture, industry, business and service sectors. Agriculture sector fulfills the food demand of the people of the country as well as provides raw material for industry. Industry sector not only fulfills the needs of food, clothing, medicine, housing etc. but also creates employment opportunities for the citizens. The business sector earns valuable foreign exchange from abroad besides making goods available in the domestic market. The service sector works to improve the quality of life of the people of the country.

Task-1: Make a list of the service sectors of Bangladesh.
Task-2: Describe the importance of the different economic sectors of Bangladesh.


## Page 34

# Lesson-4: Economic potential of Bangladesh 

Bangladesh is a developing country. We have made enough progress in different economic sectors after the independence. But like other developing countries of the world, we also have some obstacles or problems on the way to progress. Such as lack of good governance and democracy, corruption, poverty and lack of education. On the other hand, Bangladesh has excellent prospect for development. Our huge manpower and fertile land are prominent among them. We need to identify our problems properly and solve them. Also we have to fully utilize our potential. We are very fortunate that our soil, water and huge manpower are a great help in the path of development. Our people are hard working. The immigrant workers of our country have proved this in foreign countries. The king of success Bangladesh has earned in the garments sector has upheld the bright prospect in the way to development.

## Road to development

## A. Turning Population to Human Resource

We need education and proper training to turn the population into human resource. Bangladesh is a country of vast population. But rate of education is very low in comparison to other developed countries. The government's allocation to education is also inadequate Most of the people are unable to take decision for the lack of education. We can make our people eager and conscious side by side improving the standard of their lives by improving proper education. With that we can turn our vast manpower into human resources by appropriate education.

## B. Development of Agriculture

Agriculture is still now our main sector for development of rural Bangladesh. We can increase the amount of our agriculture production by using modern tools, hybrid seeds, fertilizer, proper insecticides and expanding irrigation facilities. At this, the standard of life of our rural people will be improved, environmental pollution will be reduced and the rural economy will be improved strengthened.

## C. Use of Natural Resources

Natural resources such as gas, oil etc. which are still unused should be used in an alternative way keeping in mind the environment. Use of natural resources should be ensured by extracting coal and utilizing wind and solar energy. Not industry, the matter of sustainable development which is useful for the future, should be thought about.


## Page 35

# D. Expansion of Industries 

The potential industrial sectors including garments, medicine, cement and ceramic have to be expanded. So that these goods can be exported in huge quantity meeting demands the country with that the quantity of earning our foreign currency will be increased and economy will also be strengthened.

## E. Building of Infra-structures

The management of roads highways, bridges, railways, supplying of water, electricity and gas has to be improved or expanded. Without this, a country cannot make progress in the fields of industry, agriculture, trades or service any way. Therefore, we will have to emphasize on building infra-structures as the condition of economic development. However, innovations in science should be used to find ways to build infrastructure with environmental degradation in mind.

## F. Planning and Implementation

A far-reaching planning and proper implementation process is necessary for the economic development of any country. All those who will formulate the plan and those who will be responsible for its implementation must give priority to the interests of the country and the protection of nature.

Task-: Mention the potential sectors in the economic development of Bangladesh.

## Lesson - 5: Preconditions for Development: Skilled Manpower

## Human Resources

Unskilled people do not come to any use of the state or society. On the other hand, skilled people not only become successful personally but also can speed up the economic activities of the state. The skilled people turn into economic resources of the state. On the contrary, the unskilled people are considered as burden of the state. The skilled people are called human resources.

For example, according to the data of the World Bank (2023), 141 crore 7 lakh and 10 thousand people live in China. All of whom are provided with education, health and accommodation. As a result, every man in China is contributing to the national economy. As the Chinese have turned into skilled manpower, the economy of China is developing rapidly.


## Page 36

# Ways of Turning Population into Human Resources 

In brief the ways of turning humans into human resources are mentioned below:
a. Providing quality education,
b. To aid in acquiring and applying technical education;
c. To aid in professional training and in acquiring skill;
d. Imparting training in productive work;
e. Teaching skills to invest in productive work;
f. To help develop innovative power;
g. Ensuring advanced healthcare and housing;
h. Creating extensive employment opportunities.

If the state can adopt the philosophy of turning its population into a resource, it can do so through education, health and the establishment of good governance. A country with a hundred percent skilled manpower cannot remain poor. The development of that country is in certain.

# Chapter Five 

## Bangladesh and Her Citizens

There was no existence of state in the primitive world even though man was born much earlier. There was no idea of citizenship. With the change of time and through various events, five to six thousand years ago some city states were established on the banks of rivers and seas. In the ancient time, the idea of state originated from the system of city states. Modern states have been formed gradually. Population of the present world is nearly eight billion. All members of this vast population are inhabitants or citizens of one or the other state. For example, we all are the inhabitants or citizens of the state named Bangladesh. What a state is, how a state is formed, what citizens mean, how citizenship is acquired-we will know all these in this chapter.

## At the end of this chapter, we will be able to-

- explain the idea of state;
- explain why Bangladesh is a state;
- explain the idea of citizen and citizenship;
- describe the system of acquiring the citizenship of Bangladesh;
- compare the system of acquiring citizenship of different countries;
- explain the role of the people for the development of the country.
- realize the active role of the citizens in the development of the country.


## Lesson-1: Concept of State

State is such an organization that has a definite territory, population, government and sovereign power. So, it can be said that there are four elements to form a state. These are population,territory, government and sovereignty. Without any one of these elements, a state cannot be formed.

## 1. Population

Population is an important elements of a state. Population is the soul of a state. Without population, a state cannot be formed. But there is no definite number or
![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)
size of a state population. Population of a state may be small or large. As, in China, the population is 141 crore 7 lakh and 10 thousand. On the other hand, a small country named San Marino has only 33 thousand 8 hundred 60 people.

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-14.png)


## Page 40

# 2. Territory 

Territory is an essential element of a state. Territory means water, land and the sky over it. However, there is no definite boundary of territory to form a state. It means that the territory of a state may be very large or very small in size. For example- the territory of India is about $32,87,263$ square kilometers. On the other hand, the total land areas of Singapore and Vatican City are 693 and 0.18 square kilometers respectively. Singapore and Vatican City are city states.

## 3. Government

Government is another important element to form a state. All functions of the state are performed by the government. The government makes law to maintain peace and order of the state and to regulate the people. People abide by all legal order of the government and express loyalty towards the government.

## 4. Sovereignty

The most important element to form a state is sovereignty. With this power, the state can give any command to anyone in the state and can compel him to carry out the order. Due to sovereignty, the state remains free from any other state or power.

Task: Make a group discussion with your classmates whether Dhaka and London can be called states and present it.

## Lesson-2: Bangladesh as a State

Bangladesh is an independent and sovereign state. Bangladesh emerged as an independent and sovereign country in the world on 16 December 1971 through the great liberation war and bloody struggle. Bangladesh has all the elements required to be a state. Let us know the elements of the state of Bangladesh.

## Population

Bangladesh has a vast population. At present, the population of Bangladesh is 16 crore 98 lakh 28 thousand 9 hundred and eleven (source: population census, 2022). About half of the population of Bangladesh is female and another half is male. A large portion of the population of Bangladesh is children.

## Page 42

# Government 

Bangladesh has cabinet form of government. Its name is 'Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.' It is a democratic government. This government is elected by the people. People abide by all kinds of rules and regulations, command and prohibition.

## Sovereignty

The state of Bangladesh possesses sovereign power. With the help of this power, the state controls all people of the country and rules the country being free from the control of other countries. For this reason, no country can interfere with internal affairs of Bangladesh.
From the above discussion, we have come to know that Bangladesh has all characteristics of a state. It has a large population, definite territory, democratic government and sovereign power.

Task: Make a group and brief a report about population, land and goverment of bangladesh.

## Lesson-3 : Citizen and Concept of Citizenship

The permanent residents of a state are called citizen.However, in the past, all inhabitants of cities were called citizen. At that time, states were formed centering small cities. These inhabitants of city states were called citizen.

At present, the concept of citizen and citizenship has been changed. Now, any person as a member of the state can be considered a citizen. A citizen must be a permanent inhabitant and must be loyal to the state. He must think of the welfare of the state and enjoy all social and political rights provided by the state. That is, a citizen has duties and responsibilities towards the state just as he has social and political rights.

Four features of the citizen
![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)

A citizen gets citizenship according to the identity of the state. As the citizens of Bangladesh, all of us have the identity of Bangladeshi for citizenship. Bangladesh is our state. So, we are the citizens of Bangladesh.

## Page 43

# Citizen and Foreigners 

Besides the inhabitants of own country, many people of different countries also live in a state. They live for many reasons such as education, business, service etc. They are known as foreigners. However, they do not live permanently. The foreigners do not have the loyalty, towards the states where they live. They can enjoy only the social rights in the state where they live in. But they cannot enjoy any political rights of the government or state. Hence, the foreigners are not citizens of the state.

Task-1: Identify the difference between a citizen and a foreigners.

## Lesson-4: Methods of Acquiring Citizenship

Citizenship is the national identity of the inhabitants or persons. A person gets this identity centering the state. There are two main ways to get citizenship.

1. Citizenship by birth and
2. Citizenship by formal grant
![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)

Those who acquire citizenship by birth are citizen by birth and those who acquire citizenship by formal grant are citizen by grant. However, those who acquire citizenship by birth have to fulfill some conditions imposed by the state.

## Acquiring Citizenship by Birth

Acquiring citizenship by birth is based on two principles:

1. Jus Sanguinis and
2. Jus Soli

## 1. Jus Sanguinis

According to this principle, the child will be the citizen of the state where its parents are citizens. If the child of any parents is born in a foreign country, he will be the citizen of the country of his parents. Most of the countries of the world follow this principle. According to
![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-18.png)

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-19.png)


## Page 44

this principle, if any child of Japanese or French parents is born in Bangladesh, he will be the citizen of Japan or France. In the same way, the child of Bangladeshi or Indian parents, despite their birth in that country, will be the citizen of Bangladesh or India respectively. Bangladesh, France, Japan, Italy etc. follow this principle.

# 2. Jus Soli 

According to this principle, the child will be the citizen of that country where he is born, though his parents belong to another country. This principle depends on the place of birth. According to this principle, if a child of Bangladeshi parents is born in the United States of America, he will be an American citizen and will get the citizenship of his parents' country. Not only this, if a child is born in a ship or embassy of a state, he will be the citizen of that country following this principle. However, very few countries of the world follow this principle. For example Australia and USA.

## Acquiring Citizenship by Formal Grant

In this method, a citizen of one country is to apply for obtaining the citizenship of another country. A citizen of one country now easily becomes a citizen of one or more than one countries. It has been possible for obtaining citizenship by formal grant. In addition to education, job and business, a citizen of one country is to live in another country for various reasons. A person living in this manner needs to get citizenship of that country. Then the person applies to the state. Scrutinizing his application, the state gives the person citizenship permanently on some conditions. After obtaining citizenship, that person can live in that country permanently. There are some conditions to achieve citizenship by grant. A person will get citizenship of a state if he-

1. marries any citizen of the state;
2. purchases property of that state;
3. lives in that state for long;
4. joins in any job in that state;
5. knows the language of that country;
6. joins the army of that state;
7. bears a good character;
8. possesses high efficiency;
9. takes a political asylum.

A person can achieve citizenship by grant fulfilling one or more conditions mentioned above. He will enjoy almost equal facilities like the citizen of that country.


## Page 45

# Dual Citizenship 

If a person gets citizenship of two countries, it is called dual citizenship. If a child of any Bangladeshi parents is born in the USA, he will automatically get citizenship of that country. On the other hand, he is also a citizen of Bangladesh for having Bangladeshi parents. In this case, after being adult, he can accept citizenship of any one of the two countries. But if he desires, he can keep citizenship of both the countries.

Task- 1 : Discuss the methods of acquiring citizenship.

## Lesson-5: Role of Citizens in Developing the country

The relation between state and citizen is inseparable. As there is a state, there are citizens. Again, the existence of a state is beyond imagination without citizens. If any citizen performs his duties and responsibilities sincerely, he is considered a good citizen. He can contribute much to the development of the state. A good citizen can play an important role in developing the state by his intelligent, conscientious, self-constraint and dedicated to the state.

As citizens of Bangladesh, We enjoy different types of privileges from the country. In exchange, we also have some important duties and responsibilities as citizens. For example, we should be educated, loyal to the state, abide by the laws, pay taxes regularly, vote for the right candidate, preserve and utilize state property and so on. We have to perform these duties and responsibilities for the development of the country.

In a modern state, the role of citizens is very important. In modern democratic states, people are owners of absolute power of the state. It is because people help one party to form the government for a definite tenure. If the government does anything which is not good for the country, people will not vote for the country the next time. Therefore, performing state administration, good governance and all types of development depend on the honesty and efficiency of the citizens. Not only the government is responsible for the development of the state, citizens also have to perform their duties perfectly. Then the country will proceed quickly towards development.

Task: Make a list of the activities you will perform as a citizen for the development of the country.

# Chapter Six 

## Environment of Bangladesh

Man lives in his own environment. Man is influenced by the elements of natural environment. With the gradual change of civilization, there has been a change in the relation between man and nature as well. Various activities of man have resulted in many environmental problems. The environment is also losing balance. We have a lot of things to do to prevent environmental problems in order to maintain a balance in the environment.
![img-20.jpeg](img-20.jpeg)

At the end of this chapter, we will be able to-

- explain man's relation with the environment;
- explain the causes of environmental problems;
- analyze the impacts of environmental problems;
- describe the action plan to prevent and control environmental problems in Bangladesh;
- prepare reports on environmental problems;
- be conscious of the importance of the environment.


## Lesson-1: Man and Environment

Man lives in his own environment. His life is affected by the elements of the environment. Four basic elements of nature are-soil, water, air and light. The sun is the main source of light and heat. Trees on soil grow up with the help of water, air, heat and light. On the basis of these elements, man's life on earth has been possible.
At the outset of the creation, man was more dependent on nature. He procured everything from nature to survive. He selected necessary things from nature to build houses. He used soil as a man tool of production the fertility of soil increases or decreases, some times soil decays and the minerals that soil contain also decreases. The increase ordecrease of the remaining three elements i.e. water, air and heat make man's life difficult.

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-20.png)


## Page 49

Man came to a stable position starting cultivation. Since then he has tried to conquer nature. He made vast cultivable land clearing forests and jungles. He produced paddy, wheat, maize and many other crops. He used some animals making them pet. He learnt to hunt and cook some of the wild animals. Again, he used hides of some animals. Even he killed ferocious animals for self-protection. Again, man planted some trees for his own needs. These trees protect him from different kinds of natural disasters.

**Task- 1:** Identify the basic elements of nature.

**Task- 2:** Identify the remarkable aspects in the relation between man and nature.

### Lesson-2 and 3: Environmental Problems: Causes and Effects

Man is a very intelligent being. He has made dams across the rivers using his knowledge. He has used the current of water to move machines. In this way, he gradually increased his domination over nature. He made large mills and factories, built cities and is driving cars and other vehicles. He has increased his comfort by making air conditioners. All these are making various kinds of sounds. Sound pollution is harmful to human health. With the increase of population and with the competition among all to live in luxury, the pressure on the environment is increasing. It can be said that the balance of man's life with soil, water, air and heat is being hampered. As a result, the environment is losing balance. Because of pollution, many children of Dhaka city are suffering from asthma. In addition, heart disease, cancer, skin disease and various kinds of allergy are increasing.

Gradually the pressure of huge population is increasing in the cities of the country. The cities cannot ensure accommodation and other facilities for the excess population. As a result, the number of slums in the cities is ever on the increase. Besides this, many swamps of the country are getting ruined for human settlement and for establishing industrial factories. Sometimes, industrial wastes get mixed with river water and make it unsuitable for use. It results in the extinction of aquatic biodiversity. In the hilly areas of Bangladesh, hills are cut to build houses on the mountain slopes and at the foot of the hills. In addition, sometimes hills are destroyed to make brick fields. All these are the causes of environmental problems. The increase of various environmental elements causes the rise of temperature in the atmosphere. The sea level rises because of global warming. For this reason, many people of the coastal regions, being marooned, become environment refugee.

Repeated cultivation of the same land reduces normal fertility of the land. Now, farmers are using chemical fertilizers along with organic fertilizers. To make fertilizer and to meet man's huge demand of cloth, medicine and various instruments, the number of factories is increasing. The black smoke, poisonous gases and wastes from these factories pollute water and air. In addition, temperature is also increasing as an


## Page 50

effect of pollution. Climate has become imbalanced due to the rise of temperature. It causes excessive rainfall, drought, storm, flood and tsunami.
Again, with the increase of population, their demand is increasing. As a result, trees are being cut down. Natural forests are disappearing. So, land erosion and rise of temperature cannot be prevented. It is even making holes in the ozone layer in the space which prevents ultra-violate rays of the sun. The use of one type of slow-moving plastics is being added to this which is causing permanent damage to the environment.
![img-21.jpeg](img-21.jpeg)

Environmental Problem: Air, Soil and Water Pollution

# Uncertain Future 

To meet the increasing demand of the people, trees, the unending source of oxygen are being destroyed. The expected amount of oxygen level is decreasing everyday due to the destruction of forests indiscriminately. The supply of essential food, medicine, fuel, etc. is going to be at risk.The imbalance of oxygen helps to increase nitrogen, carbon-dioxide and other temperature increasing gases.

To ensure our comfort and luxury, in the same way, we are exhausting various element of nature including mineral resources, birds and animals, rivers and canals. Many species of animal which helped us in our struggle for survival have become extinct.
Gradual warming of the globe raises the sea levels by melting the ice in the two poles. For this reason, the low-lying areas of the coastal countries are feared to be submerged. Many countries including Bangladesh may be affected.

Task-1: Identify men made environmental problems and their harmful impacts.
Task-2: Explain why the environmental problem of Bangladesh is a concern for the future generations.

## Lesson-4 and 5: Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Environmental Problem in Bangladesh

People of Bangladesh suffer from various problems because of environmental problem. Should we let these problems occur? The United Nations has taken many measures in this regard. Our government has also taken some steps. All of us including children should be conscious of it. We should bear in mind that--

# Chapter Seven

## Children's Growth and Obstacles: Socialization

A child's growth starts from the family. The child has to adapt to the new environment after crossing the family boundary. The process of adjusting with new environment and new situation is called socialization. However, there are a number of obstacles for a child to grow up in the society. It is very important to overcome these hindrances; otherwise children have to grow up with mental problems. In this chapter, we will know about raising children in the society and various obstacles which children have to face in growing up.

![img-23.jpeg](img-23.jpeg)

At the end of this chapter, we will be able to:

- Explain the idea of the process of socialization and its impact;
- Describe the medium and importance of socialization;
- Explain the idea, causes and effects of child labour;
- Describe what our attitude towards working children should be;
- Acquire the ability to develop human and social relationships through socialization;
- Be conscious of the rights and other things of the working children.

## Lesson- 1: Socialization and its effects on social life

We grow up in the society through various processes. We get the identity of the social being. The education we get from society is our social education. Rules and regulations, values, beliefs, ideal etc. are included in this education. The process through which we get social education and become worthy members of society is

![Image](uploads\class_six_bgs_english\images\img-23.png)


## Page 55

called socialization. Socialization is a life-long process. It continues from the birth of a child till death.

When a baby is born, the mother fulfills the baby's initial needs. For this reason, mother becomes the role model for children. After some time, the child realizes the presence of its father and other people, and so, the boundary of its social relation spreads further. Subsequently, the child becomes a social being through different mediums including neighbours, age-mates, play-mates, class-mates and religious institutions. Thus, a child acquires several qualities like ideals, values, rules, responsibilities, duties and tolerance, and is encouraged to play the role as a social being.
Socialization has a great influence in social life. This process turns a child into a man. It helps a child develop healthily and nicely. It also helps a child become a worthy citizen. Socialization makes children responsible members of the society and helps maintain peace and order in the society. This process teaches children expected manners in the society. For example, our society expects that all men and women will help and co-operate each other. If we become habituated to this, we shall be able to behave in line with the social expectation. Socialization also develops necessary skills in the life of children. Using acquired skill, children can face many risks and problems in life.

Task-1: Explain the socialization process of a child.
Task-2: Make a list of the mediums of socialization.
Task-3: Getting divided into groups, identify and present the impacts of socialization.

# Lesson-2 and 3 : Mediums and Importance of Socialization 

Several mediums of socialization and their significance are-
Family: Socialization of children begins from family. The characteristic qualities of children develop in family environment. From the family, children acquire social anchor teachings like co-operation, tolerance, friendship, brotherhood, self-sacrifice, love etc. If the relationship between the family members is sweet, the child can grow up in a good family environment. On the other hand, family turmoil, conflicts, frictions, fights hinder the normal growth of the child. If family harmony is not practiced, children cannot learn it. Therefore, the learning of honesty and friendship should be acquired from the family.
Neighbours: Those who live near our houses are our neighbours. Children of same age can form a team among their neighbours. Through it, they can learn mutual co-operation, fellow feeling, equity, unity etc.
Educational Institutions: Besides acquiring knowledge, children learn several social ideals at educational institutions. These ideals are- sense of discipline, sense of responsibility, sense of respect, co-operation, sympathy, mutual admiration etc.Taking part in different programmes of the educational institutions, children learn


## Page 56

social etiquettes, manners and values. Children learn about sharing with other through their education. This helps them develop altruism. Contents of text books also influence children's manners. Therefore, the role of educational institutions is very important for socialization.
Class-mates and Play-mates: The role of class-mates and play-mates is not less important in the socialization of children. Children can acquire leadership quality mixing with the class-mates and play-mates. Listening to the criticism of good and bad, children learn expected manners. However, bad class-mates and play-mates instigate children to take part in anti-social activities. So, we have to be careful to select our class-mates and play-mates.
Religion: Religion is a kind of belief which is expressed through certain rituals and festivals. The basic principle of every religion is to call individuals to justice and human welfare and keep them away from injustice and evils. Mosques, temples, churches, pagodas and other religious institutions influence the people of Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist community in many ways. Religion instills social values in human minds; confers them several qualities like co-operation, dutifulness, justness, sympathy etc. It teaches us to be honest and just. If we follow the religious rules and allow others to follow their religion, it is possible to maintain harmony with all people irrespective of caste, colour, creed, male or female.
Mass Media: The mediums of presenting news, opinion, recreation etc. to the people are called mass media. Various mass media, such as- newspaper, magazine, radio, television, movie etc. play an important role in socialization. Newspapers and magazines provide different information about social values, customs, traditions, culture and education which contribute to the socialization of children. The radio plays a role in children's socialization broadcasting recreational and instructive programmes. Information collected from television plays an active role in socializing children who can listen and see the programmes simultaneously. Films can also contribute to socialization if they are not only amusing but also realistic and educative. This type of movie plays an important role in moulding the attitude of children. Nowadays, internet plays a vital role in entertaining and socializing children. Elders should play role to control its use.

Task-1: Identify the role of family in socializing children.
Task-2: Identify the roles of play-mates and class-mates in the socialization of children.

# Lesson- 4 and 5 : Concept, Causes and Effects of Child Labour 

We often notice that many children, instead of going to school, do different types of work. Again, many other children do many works besides studying at school. However, every child has to do some works that is not harmful, rather that is helpful for better living for himself and for his family. For example - a child can help the parents work or other family members by doing any work. The child is not forced to do these works. But there are some works which are harmful to children. This type of work is called


## Page 57

child labour. Therefore, If the children face with danger, risk, exploitation and deprivation in working for earning money, that work is called child labour. In Bangladesh, child labour is prohibited. Children of our country are doing domestic work in other people's house, working in different mills and factories, such as- making churi, biri, battery, shoe etc. Children are also working in chemical factories, lead and wielding machines. Many children work as helper of bus and tempo. Again, some other children look for sellable materials from the wastes. But why are they doing all these works?

There are many reasons for child labour. Many guardians are compelled to send children to work instead of sending them to school because of economic insolvency. Besides, if parents are sick or separated, sometimes children are compelled to earn money. Children are in household work or in brick fields as children work at low wages. In addition, because of devastating natural disasters, many children drop out from school and work as child labourers. Guardians' discriminatory treatment towards male and female children also turns female children into child labourer.
Risky labour is harmful to children's physical and mental health. Because of excessive labour, they are attacked with infectious diseases. A kind of mental reaction is created among the child labourers when they see same age children going to school, playing and going on an outing with their parents. They also crave for these. So, inferiority complex in the minds of children results from unfulfilled demand. Children cannot demonstrate their normal behaviour. They lose their esteem for the society and its people. A sort of ferocity and aggression is created on the minds of children. These children may become passionless, fearless and terrible. Development of a child labourer is affected by malnutrition, sleeplessness and restlessness. We shall refrain ourselves from harmful and risky labour and help others refrain from it.

# Lesson-6 : Our Attitude towards Child Workers 

Many children of your age work in households, mills and factories or at other workplaces. Many a times, these children do not get their due wages, food and health facilities. These children do not know what are affection, love and adoration. Physical and mental tortures are their daily companion. Yet, they also have their right to grow up.

We should behave well with them. They should be given the scope of education. If any child works in the household, we have to help him/her. We ourselves can do Some personal works like arranging house, bed, table and folding dry cloth. It will lessen the child's pressure of work. If the child falls ill any time, we have to show sympathy through ensuring medical treatment and taking proper care. In this way, the child will become our friend. We have to make him/her our play-mate. The child must be considered a member of our family. It will help the child develop physically and mentally. Now think, in how many more ways, we can help these children.

If children grow up in good environment, they will be more responsible to family and society. Through good behaviour towards these children, we ourselves will become citizens with human qualities. We will also tell others to behave well with them.

Task: What should be our treatment to house assistants.

If the neighbouring countries help and co-operate one another, any problem can be easily solved. For this reason, countries of the same region mutually co-operate one another. As a result, different organizations of regional cooperation are formed. Through collective effort, they work for removing economic, political and commercial obstacles in these regions.
